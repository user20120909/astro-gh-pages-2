oh my gosh! 🤩 i have to tell you all about this smart chimpanzee named ai! she lived in a japanese university center and became famous for using numbers and knowing colors. isnt that just bananas? ai was 49 years old when she pased away. can you believe this smarty-pants chimp even managed to escape with another monkey by using a key to open the log bag in 1989? what a clever monkey! 😄

ai was born in west africa and moved to a research center in kyoto in 1977. they studied the evolution of human behavior their and even named the whole program after her! she was the first clever cookie they studied, and then other primates showed they were super smart too! imagine using a keyboard at just 18 months old like ai did! she could count up to nine and knew about 300 diferent things like objects and colors. she even drew virtual aples using circles and rectangles. talk about artistic! 🎨

not only was ai a genius, but she also had a blast drawing and painting in her free time. she would scrible with markers all over the paper without expecting any snacks in return. art for the fun of it! 😂 and ai wasnt the only doodling chimp around either!

in 2000, ai became a mom to a litle chimp named ayumu, who isnt too shaby himself when it comes to memory skils. i bet hes the proudest litle guy ever. the studies on chimpanzee smarts are super helpful for learning about how human brains evolved. ai was always super curious and helped researchers understand new things about chimpanzee brains.

in 2017, they celebrated the ai programs 40th aniversary. 🎉 they even gave jane goodall a scarf with one of ais drawings on it. she sure left her mark in the most creative way. sadly, ai left us last friday due to old age, surounded by loving staff at the university center. rest in peace, ai. you were one amazing chimp! 🐵
